# broadlink2mqtt (working in progress)
- This library is useful for serialize your IR/RF codes (encoded in base64) in a config file.
# futures milestones
- Like second objetive, I want associate commands (IR/RF codes serialized) in topics of MQTT.
- Also, I want let build composite commands configuring delays between commands.

# Requirements:
- [Broadlink RM Pro](https://es.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20170730235037&SearchText=Broadlink+RM+Pro)
- IR/RF products [like this](https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B01M6WWKFD/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
